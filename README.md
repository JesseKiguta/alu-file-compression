# Compress Files and Folders Assignment

## Introduction
For this assignment, we were required to write a Python program that allows users to compress files and folders to any compressed file type they choose (e.g., .zip, .tar, .tgz, etc.)

## Deliverable
The python script, `compression_script.py`.

## Usage
This is a step-by-step procedure on how to run the script. This procedure assumes that you, the user, have the necessary libraries and tools installed to perform the compression.

1. Clone this repository to your IDE using the `git clone` command.
2. Run the script in the terminal.
3. Enter the file path of the file you want to compress when prompted.
4. Enter a compression type for the compressed file (Choose from the list provided).
5. The program returns a message whether the operation was a success or failure.

Note: If compressing a folder, ensure it isn't empty.
